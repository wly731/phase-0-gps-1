* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had a bit struggles on:
1. git branch, why the git log still remains even I delete the branch and re-create a branch using the same name
2. git push, how can I git push en empty folder
3. When to use git init
4. For git fetch origin master and git merge origin/master, what is the meaning of origin?

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Question 1 was answered and I understand it is a always a good practice not to use the same branch over different projects since the git log still remains and shows changes history of other projects which may create confusion.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide Gary questions 1 above. I also asked him whether it is possible to have a quick review of .md files on local computers after making some markdown format changes and the answer is no. I asked my peer Ian if we have to push the changes made in master before we can create the small conflict in release 5.

* What still confuses you about git?
Question 2,3 and 4 above.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great! Nice working with Ian my first GPS peer and nice introduction and guidance from the guide Gary!
