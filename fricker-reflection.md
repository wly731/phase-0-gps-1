## GPS 1.1 - Version Control and Git Reflection
#### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The concept that I did not 100% understand was the difference between a pull request and a fetch/merge request.  Our guide, Gary, was able to explain to us the difference.  The basically do the same thing but the fetch/merge method adds one more level of checking the code changes.

#### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The guided pairing session clarified all of the git commands.  It was nice being comfortable working with someone else and see that we both were doing everything correctly.

#### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We asked about the difference between a pull request and a fetch/merge.  We asked a clarification on when during the exercise to push/pull.

#### What still confuses you about git?
Their is no one thing that confuses me about git.  For me it is just going to become familiar with the process.

#### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first pair went well.  I don't think ether of us were far ahead or behind each other in familiarity with git.  The git process is pretty straight forward and I am very interested in seeing how people solve problems when their may be more than one way to complete it.
